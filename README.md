Prerequisities
--------------

Install Android Studio IDE (recommended version is 2.2 or newer):
https://developer.android.com/studio/install.html

Then, using the SDK Manager tool, install one or more Android SDKs. Notice that for Orion360 SDK Basic, minimum API level is 14: Android 4.0 IceCreamSandwitch.

Cloning the project
-------------------

> You can either create the project from scratch by following the instructions below, or clone the ready project from GitHub as explained here.

To clone the project from GitHub, start Android Studio, select "Check out project from Version Control" and "Git" from the popup dialog.

Acquiring Orion360 SDK binaries
-------------------------------

Now that the application project skeleton is working, let's add 360 video playback capability using Orion360 SDK.

First, we need to acquire Orion360 SDK binaries. To make this super easy for developers, we distribute them via our public repository at bintray.com. Let's add the repository to the project.

In Android Studio's Project view, expand Gradle Scripts and double click build.gradle file for the Project.

![alt tag](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12032146/18170765/35fe720c-7068-11e6-947d-364d53b1a043.png)

Find section 'allprojects' and add the following line inside 'repositories':

```gradle
maven { url 'https://finwe.bintray.com/orion360-sdk-public' } // For Orion360 SDK
```

After editing a gradle file, the IDE suggests to sync the project. Accept the suggestion, or click the Sync button from the toolbar.

![alt tag](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12032146/18171065/4e2430aa-7069-11e6-8811-fcbbec81e86f.png)

After gradle sync has finished, in Android Studio's Project view, double click build.gradle file for the app module. Find section 'dependencies', and add the following line inside it:

```gradle
compile 'fi.finwe.orion360:orion360-sdk-basic:1.2.00' // From Finwe maven repo at Bintray
```

After editing a gradle file, the IDE suggests to sync the project. Accept the suggestion, or click the Sync button from the toolbar.

Notice that here we will use version '1.2.00' of the SDK binaries. When new versions are released, you can simply type here the version number that you wish to use in your project. Upgrading to the latest Orion360 version requires nothing more than changing the version number, performing gradle sync, and rebuilding the app (unless there are API changes).

![alt tag](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12032146/18171532/0f740f72-706b-11e6-8cce-ca475b58a332.png)

Now we can use Orion360 SDK in the project. 

Adding OrionVideoView to the XML layout
---------------------------------------

In Android Studio's Project view, expand res > layout and double click activity_main.xml. Select 'Text' pane to hide the designer and show the layout's XML code. Then, above TextView item, add the following lines:

```xml
<fi.finwe.orion360.OrionVideoView
  android:id="@+id/orion_video_view"
  android:layout_width="match_parent"
  android:layout_height="match_parent" />
```

![alt tag](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12032146/18171902/39551fc4-706c-11e6-919d-8ab34323f89d.png)

If you now switch back to 'Design' tab, you can see that the video view will expand to fill the layout.

![alt tag](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12032146/18171955/68955dee-706c-11e6-8d00-690fea36c5ef.png)

Writing Java code
-----------------

In Android Studio's Project view, expand java > [package name] and double click MainActivity. 

Add a class member variable for the video view, and press ALT+ENTER when Android Studio suggests to import the missing class (fi.finwe.orion360.OrionVideoView).

```java
private OrionVideoView mOrionVideoView;
```

Then append to onCreate() method a line to retrieve the video view object that we defined in the activity's XML layout:

```java
mOrionVideoView = (OrionVideoView) findViewById(R.id.orion_video_view);
```

Preparing a video for playback always takes a moment, therefore we need to become a listener for a callback that tells when the video player is ready. When the callback comes, we can start the player.

```java
mOrionVideoView.setOnPreparedListener(new OrionVideoView.OnPreparedListener() {
  @Override
  public void onPrepared(OrionVideoView orionVideoView) {
    mOrionVideoView.start();
  }
});
```

You can play a 360 video file by calling the prepare() method. When called, Orion360 SDK will first check if a valid license file is available, and then proceed to preparing the video player. When done, onPrepared() will be called - and the playback begins, as we have requested above.

```java
try {
  mOrionVideoView.prepare("http://www.finwe.mobi/orion360/test/equi/Orion360_test_video_1920x960.mp4");
} catch (OrionVideoView.LicenseVerificationException e) {
  Log.e("OrionVideoView", "Orion360 SDK license could not be verified!", e);
}
```

Finally, we need to let the video player to respond to the activity's life cycle events, so that it can automatically pause and resume along the activity, and clean up when the activity gets destroyed. Let's propagate them to the video view as follows:

```java
    @Override
    public void onStart() {
        super.onStart();

        mOrionVideoView.onStart();
    }

    @Override
    public void onResume() {
        super.onResume();

        mOrionVideoView.onResume();
    }

    @Override
    public void onPause() {
        mOrionVideoView.onPause();

        super.onPause();
    }

    @Override
    public void onStop() {
        mOrionVideoView.onStop();

        super.onStop();
    }

    @Override
    public void onDestroy() {
        mOrionVideoView.onDestroy();

        super.onDestroy();
    }
```

Now we have written all Java code that is required for a basic 360 video player.

Adding Android permissions
--------------------------

Since we are going to stream a video file from the network, we must add INTERNET permission to the application project's manifest file, as usual. In Android Studio's Project view, expand app > manifests, and double click AndroidManifest.xml. Then add the following line above 'application' section:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
```

![alt tag](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12032146/18173579/c98d8706-7072-11e6-8d7c-5c9aecf39abf.png)

Acquiring Orion360 SDK license file
-----------------------------------

As Orion360 SDK is a commercial product, it requires a license file to work. In order to get a license file for your own app, you need to buy the SDK. Your license file will be locked to the package name you have selected for your app. To apply the license file, in the Android Studio's Project view, create a directory 'assets' under the 'app' root, and download and copy the license file there.

However, to continue evaluating the SDK with the hello app, you can use the (watermarked) license file that is provided with this tutorial. Following the instructions above, download and copy this file under your project's /assets folder:

[Orion Hello License File](app/src/main/assets/fi.finwe.orion360.sdk.basic.hello.key.lic)

> **Notice that the license file is a simple text file, but since it is signed, any kind of editing makes it invalid. Especially, watch out line endings - file editors, version control software and copy-paste operation may silently convert between CR/LF and LF characters, and even though the file looks exactly the same, it isn't!**

Running the application
-----------------------

Now we are ready to try the app on device. From Android Studio menu, select Run > Run 'app', and when the 'Select Deployment Target' dialog appears, check that your device shows up in the "Connected Devices" list, and is selected. Click OK. The application will be built and deployed to your device.

![alt tag](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12032146/18173844/e18644f0-7073-11e6-84ea-82275531210e.png)

The application begins to stream the video file from network, and when the media player has buffered enough content, video starts to play on screen. Since this is a 360 video, you can look around: try out panning by rotating the device around you or by pulling the image with a finger. Use 2-finger pinch and rotate to zoom and rotate the image, respectively.

In just a few minutes, you have created your own 360 video player app that can play equirectangular MP4 video files from the network and supports gyro and touch panning, as well as pinch zooming and rotating. Pretty cool, ha?

What next?
